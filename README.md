# Admission_classification
 A logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
We want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. We have historical data from previous applicants
that we can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, we have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions
decision.
Our task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant's
probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.
